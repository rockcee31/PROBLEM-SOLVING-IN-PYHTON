#how loops works

#PRINT hello
# print("hello")

#print 3times i will say okay
# print("hello")
# print("hello")
# print("hello")

#print 100 time will you write print 100 time no it is tough right so here loops comes whenever you have to do a repeative time many time than we use loops
#doing this over and over again
#for loop and while

#for loop how it works 

#using for loop print 20 time bye
# first you have to pass range how many time you want to run in run 0,20 it will run for each number do thing which is inside it for every range value

# for i in range(0,20): 
#     print("bye") # once code is executed for a value is by defalut it do +1 in range 
   
#if you want to go in descending order 
# for i in range(20,0,-1):
#     print(i)
    
#you can also do jump of +2

# for i in range(2,11,2):
#     print(i)

# move through each value of array
# order = [1,2,3,4]
# length = len(order)
# for i in range(length):
#     print(order[i])

# # count element which occur more than ones
# str = "smmtjsgfg"
# length = len(str)
# for i in range(length):
#     print(f"count of {str[i] } is {str.count(str[i])}")
